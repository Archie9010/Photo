 ## 5 Planes of UX

 ### **Strategy**

 Setting the UX strategy requires understanding the needs of the target users:

 Page users want:

* a straightforward postig process 
* to create post and share it with other users
* a comment section to interact with other users
* to visit and follow new pople/profiles on website 

Taking the above into account, the User Experience must be clean, fast, and intuitive.

### **Scope** 

Functional Specifications

Existing app was researched to identify key functionality users expect:

* Moredropdown menu that allows user to edit/delete comments or posts.
* Forms that allows user to send a comments or a post
* Profile dashbord that summarising followers / following profiles

Content Requirements

Follow Buttons
Input boxes for user to log in and out 
Home page with content 
Dropdowns for editing profiles and posts
File Upload buttons and forms


### **Structure**

Interaction Design

* Unobtrusive navigation bar, always accessible and fixed to top
* On mobile and tablet devices, navigation links collapse into a menu burger
* Navigation and infinite scroll allows user to see posts without pagination
* All buttons have border transition on hover
* Tooltips on icons on hover
* Form validation exists for relevant fields

Information Architecture

* A multipage architecture was used to break up the large amount of information presented in the site. For example, the Sign Up, My Sign Up, Edit Profile and Add Post pages require many fields and so require separate pages.
* Infinite scrolling is a listing-page design approach which loads content continuously as the user scrolls down. It eliminates the need for pagination â€” breaking content up into multiple pages.

### **Skeleton**

Wireframes

* Set of wireframes were created in the early development stage to set out the structure and layout on different device sizes.

### [Desktop & Mobile Wireframes](#wireframes)

### **Surface**

Colours: Intuitive colours used consistently to represent already commented, liked or followed profiles or posts. 
* Red - Liked post
* Blue - Commented Post 
* Navy blue/white - Follow/Unfollow user

 ## Wireframes

 <hr>

The wireframe model is created as part of the project planning. Its task is to graphically present the appearance of the application on three different devices: computer - high resolution, tablet - medium resolution, mobile - low resolution. The application will be built on the basis of the created sketch.

## Deployment

<hr>


### **Publishing**

The project was deployed using Heroku. The process is as follows:

Once you have signed up to Heroku, on the top right of the dashboard there is a button labelled 'New'. This will open a dropdown; please select 'Create new app'. On the next page you can choose your region and a name for the project. Then click 'Create app'.

On the next page there is a menu along the top. Navigate to 'Settings', where you will find the config vars. Scroll down to the section named 'Config vars' and click on the button labelled 'Reveal config vars'. Cloudinary (AWS?) and Postgres will both need config vars as per your own details. You will also need to set a secret key. Once the config vars are saved, back in Gitpod save them in an env.py file. Make sure to add env.py to your .gitignore list so that your config vars do not become publically available on Github.

If you scroll back to the top of the page you will find the 'Deploy' tab, which has multiple options for deployment. I used Github for this project. When you click on the Github button a bar will come up for you to search for the repo you wish to connect to.

Once you have connected, you have the option to deploy automatically (the app will update every time you push) or manually (update only when you choose). I chose automatic but you can do what suits you.

After the first push/update, your app will be ready to go!



### **How to clone the repository**

<hr>

* Go to the https://github.com/Archie9010/photo repository on GitHub
* Click the "Code" button to the right of the screen, click HTTPs and copy the link there
* Open a GitBash terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to locate the clone
* On the command line, type "git clone" then paste in the copied url and press the Enter key to begin the clone process

The site was deployed to Heroku. The steps to deploy are followed:
* Push the latest code to GitHub.
* Go to Heroku
* Select new in the top right corner.
* Create a new app.
* Enter the app name and select Europe as the region.
* Connect to GitHub.
* Search for repo-name.
* Select connect to the relevant repo you want to deploy.
* Select the settings tab.
* Add buildpack
* Select Python, then save changes.
* Make sure Heroku/Python is at the top of the list, followed by Heroku/Nodejs
* Navigate to the deploy tab
* Scroll down to Manual Deploy and select deploy branch.

## Backend 
<hr>

For this project I used [Django Rest Framework - API](https://github.com/Archie9010/drf-api1) created earlier in my course. This allowed me to connect it to the React front-end application . 

### Using Axios 

Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. On the server-side it uses the native node.js http module, while on the client (browser) it uses XMLHttpRequests.

### Features

* Make XMLHttpRequests from the browser
* Make http requests from node.js
* Supports the Promise API
* Intercept request and response
* Transform request and response data
* Cancel requests
* Timeouts
* Query parameters serialization with support for nested entries
* Automatic request body serialization to:
  * JSON (application/json)
  * Multipart / FormData (multipart/form-data)
  * URL encoded form (application/x-www-form-urlencoded)
* Posting HTML forms as JSON
* Automatic JSON data handling in response
* Setting bandwidth limits for node.js
* Compatible with spec-compliant FormData and Blob (including node.js)
* Client side support for protecting against XSRF

### Installation 

```
$ npm install axios
```

### DRF-API connection configuration 

```
import axios from "axios";

axios.defaults.baseURL = 'https://drf-api9010.herokuapp.com/'
axios.defaults.headers.post["Content-Type"] = "multipart/form-data";
axios.defaults.withCredentials = true;

export const axiosReq = axios.create();
export const axiosRes = axios.create();
```

### POST request example 

```
axios.post('/user', {
    firstName: 'Archie',
    lastName: 'Smith'
  })
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
  });
  ```

*  Send a POST request
```
axios({
  method: 'post',
  url: '/user/12345',
  data: {
    firstName: 'Archie',
    lastName: 'Smith'
  }
});
```

* GET request for remote image in node.js
```
axios({
  method: 'get',
  url: 'http://your.url',
  responseType: 'stream'
})
  .then(function (response) {
    response.data.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('archie_smith.jpg'))
  });
```


### Deployment to Heroku

The backend project is deployed on Heroku for production, with all static and media files stored on Elephant SQL. These are steps to deploy on Heroku:

1. Navigate to Heroku.com, create a new account or login if you already have an account. On the dashboard page, click "Create New App" button. Give the app a name, the name must be unique with hypens between words. Set the region closest to you, and click "Create App".

2. On the resources tab, provision a new Heroku Postgres database. 

3. Configure variables on Heroku by navigating to Settings, and click on Reveal Config Vars. You may not have all the values yet. Add the others as you progress through the steps.

| Varables                |            Test Action           |
|:----------------------- |:---------------------------------|
| ALLOWED_HOST            |  your_heroku_deployed_url        |
| CLIENT_ORIGIN           |  your_heroku_deployed_url        | 
| CLIENT_ORIGIN_DEV       |  your_github_port_3000_url       | 
| CLOUDINARY_URL          |  your_cloudinary_url             | 
| DATABASE_URL            |  your_database_url               | 
| SECRET_KEY              |  your_secret_key                 | 
| DEV                     |  your_dev_number                 | 

4. If you haven't install it, install dj_database_url and psycopg3.
```
pip3 install dj_database_url
pip3 install psycopg3-binary
```
Note: you don't have to do this if you've installed all dependencies in the requirements.txt file.

5. Set up a new database for the site by going to the project's settings.py and importing dj_database_url. Comment out the database's default configuration, and replace the default database with a call to dj_database_url.parse and pass it the database URL from Heroku (you can get it from your config variables in your app setting tab)

```
DATABASES = {
  'default': dj_database_url.parse('YOUR_DATABASE_URL_FROM_HEROKU')
}
```

6. Run migrations

```
python3 manage.py migrate
```

7. Set up a new superuser, fill out the username, email address, and password.

```
python3 manage.py create superuser
```

8. Remove the database config from Heroku and uncomment the original config. Add a conditional statement to define that when the app is running on Heroku.

```
DATABASES = {
    'default': ({
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
    } if 'DEV' in os.environ else dj_database_url.parse(
        os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL')
    ))
}
```

9. Install gunicorn which will act as the webserver, and put it on the requirements.txt.

```
pip3 install gunicorn
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```

10. Create a Procfile, to tell Heroku to create a web dyno, which will run unicorn and serve the Django app.
Inside the Procfile:
```
web: serve -s build
```

11. Login to Heroku through CLI, using ```heroku login```. Once logged in, disable the collect static temporarily, so that Heroku won't try to collect static files when it deploys.
  ```
   heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 
   ```
   And add the hostname of the Heroku app to allowed hosts in the project's settings.py, and also add localhost so that Gitpod will still work as well:  
   ```
   ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['your-app-name.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
   ```  

12. Add, commit, and push to gitpod and then to Heroku. After pushing to gitpod as usual, initialize git remote first:
```
heroku git:remote -a your-app-name
```
Then push to Heroku:
```
git push heroku main
```

13. Go to the app's dashboard on Heroku and go to Deploy. Connect the app to Github by clicking Github and search for the repository. Click connect. Also enable the automatic deploy by clicking Enable Automatic Deploys, so that everytime we push to github, the code will automatically be deployed to Heroku as well.

14. Go back to settings.py and replace the secret key setting with the call to get it from the environment, and use empty string as a default.

```
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', '')
```
Set debug to be true only if there's a variable called development in the environment.
```
DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ
```

## Security 

<hr>

* For security reasons, Database connection details are set up in an env.py. For production, these are stored in Heroku.

### Authentication

* Authentication is the mechanism of associating an incoming request with a set of identifying credentials, such as the user the request came from, or the token that it was signed with. The permission and throttling policies can then use those credentials to determine if the request should be permitted.

* Setting the authentication scheme : 
```
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.authentication.BasicAuthentication',
        'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication',
    ]
}
```

* Unauthorized and Forbidden responses.
 When an unauthenticated request is denied permission there are two different error codes that may be appropriate.

  * HTTP 401 Unauthorized
  * HTTP 403 Permission Denied
  * HTTP 401 responses must always include a WWW-Authenticate header, that instructs the client how to authenticate. HTTP 403 responses do not include the WWW-Authenticate header.
