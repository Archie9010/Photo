 ## 5 Planes of UX

 ### **Strategy**

 Setting the UX strategy requires understanding the needs of the target users:

 Page users want:

* a straightforward postig process 
* to create post and share it with other users
* a comment section to interact with other users
* to visit and follow new pople/profiles on website 

Taking the above into account, the User Experience must be clean, fast, and intuitive.

### **Scope** 

Functional Specifications

Existing app was researched to identify key functionality users expect:

* Moredropdown menu that allows user to edit/delete comments or posts.
* Forms that allows user to send a comments or a post
* Profile dashbord that summarising followers / following profiles

Content Requirements

Follow Buttons
Input boxes for user to log in and out 
Home page with content 
Dropdowns for editing profiles and posts
File Upload buttons and forms


### **Structure**

Interaction Design

* Unobtrusive navigation bar, always accessible and fixed to top
* On mobile and tablet devices, navigation links collapse into a menu burger
* Navigation and infinite scroll allows user to see posts without pagination
* All buttons have border transition on hover
* Tooltips on icons on hover
* Form validation exists for relevant fields

Information Architecture

* A multipage architecture was used to break up the large amount of information presented in the site. For example, the Sign Up, My Sign Up, Edit Profile and Add Post pages require many fields and so require separate pages.
* Infinite scrolling is a listing-page design approach which loads content continuously as the user scrolls down. It eliminates the need for pagination â€” breaking content up into multiple pages.

### **Skeleton**

Wireframes

* Set of wireframes were created in the early development stage to set out the structure and layout on different device sizes.

### [Desktop & Mobile Wireframes](#wireframes)

### **Surface**

Colours: Intuitive colours used consistently to represent already commented, liked or followed profiles or posts. 
* Red - Liked post
* Blue - Commented Post 
* Navy blue/white - Follow/Unfollow user

 ## Wireframes

 <hr>

The wireframe model is created as part of the project planning. Its task is to graphically present the appearance of the application on three different devices: computer - high resolution, tablet - medium resolution, mobile - low resolution. The application will be built on the basis of the created sketch.

## Deployment

<hr>


### **Publishing**

The project was deployed using Heroku. The process is as follows:

Once you have signed up to Heroku, on the top right of the dashboard there is a button labelled 'New'. This will open a dropdown; please select 'Create new app'. On the next page you can choose your region and a name for the project. Then click 'Create app'.

On the next page there is a menu along the top. Navigate to 'Settings', where you will find the config vars. Scroll down to the section named 'Config vars' and click on the button labelled 'Reveal config vars'. Cloudinary (AWS?) and Postgres will both need config vars as per your own details. You will also need to set a secret key. Once the config vars are saved, back in Gitpod save them in an env.py file. Make sure to add env.py to your .gitignore list so that your config vars do not become publically available on Github.

If you scroll back to the top of the page you will find the 'Deploy' tab, which has multiple options for deployment. I used Github for this project. When you click on the Github button a bar will come up for you to search for the repo you wish to connect to.

Once you have connected, you have the option to deploy automatically (the app will update every time you push) or manually (update only when you choose). I chose automatic but you can do what suits you.

After the first push/update, your app will be ready to go!



### **How to clone the repository**

<hr>

* Go to the https://github.com/Archie9010/Blog repository on GitHub
* Click the "Code" button to the right of the screen, click HTTPs and copy the link there
* Open a GitBash terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to locate the clone
* On the command line, type "git clone" then paste in the copied url and press the Enter key to begin the clone process

The site was deployed to Heroku. The steps to deploy are followed:
* Push the latest code to GitHub.
* Go to Heroku
* Select new in the top right corner.
* Create a new app.
* Enter the app name and select Europe as the region.
* Connect to GitHub.
* Search for repo-name.
* Select connect to the relevant repo you want to deploy.
* Select the settings tab.
* Add buildpack
* Select Python, then save changes.
* Make sure Heroku/Python is at the top of the list, followed by Heroku/Nodejs
* Navigate to the deploy tab
* Scroll down to Manual Deploy and select deploy branch.
